# Klobuchar
Klobuchar model is a simple model of ionospheric signal delay used in GPS.

GPS satellites broadcast 8 Klobuchar coefficients which can be used to reconstruct vertical ionospheric delays globally.

This python script visualises the ionospheric delay specified by the Klobuchar coefficients on a spherical body
